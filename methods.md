# Core Temperature Estimation of Electric Vehicle Battery Packs

## Methodology
<br/>

### Unsupervised Learning
A variety of unsupervised algorithms will be explored to understand the relationships between the features. We will begin with correlation analysis, potentially apply clustering techniques, and perform feature selection and dimensionality reduction using PCA or similar techniques to gain data insights.
<br/><br/>

### Supervised Learning
Temperature being a real-valued quantity, makes the task a regression problem. A multitude of regression models will be evaluated. Starting with linear regression, we intend to explore polynomial regression, regularized regression, neural networks, etc. All models will be trained on a subset of the dataset, and evaluated on the remaining. Model parameters will be tuned using cross-validation techniques.
