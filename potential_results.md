## Potential / Expected Results
<br/>

We expect to predict battery temperature well. We will judge our models using an error metric that is a function of (true temperature - estimated temperature). One possible candidate is the worst-case temperature estimation error over an entire trip, which is physically more meaningful than common metrics like mean-square error.
