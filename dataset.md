## Dataset
<br/>

The dataset for this project is available [here](https://ieee-dataport.org/open-access/battery-and-heating-data-real-driving-cycles). This data was collected as part of a research effort unrelated to temperature estimation [\[8\]](references) on recuperation of thermal energy in EVs. A vehicle (BMW i3) was specially-instrumented, and high-resolution time-series data was collected over 72 trips on different regions, seasons, and terrains. The resulting dataset contains ~500,000 observations of 28 features, including the battery temperature (our target).
