## Literature Review and Novelty
<br/>

In the research community, estimation of core battery temperature is done on the basis of current, voltage (together, impedance), and state-of-charge measurements [\[4-7\]](/references). In each of [\[4-7\]](/references), an empirical relationship is developed between battery temperature, impedance, and other factors (e.g. state-of-charge, age) in a laboratory. This relationship is then accessed in real-time to predict temperature based on state-of-charge and impedance measurements.
<br/><br/>

The methods in [\[4-7\]](/references) are effective, but fail to consider battery-loading, which is a significant contributing factor to temperature rise, and is therefore considered in our work. We will use measurement data collected during vehicle motion to estimate temperature on-line, which has not been done before.
